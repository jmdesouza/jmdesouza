- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmdesouza
- 👀 I’m interested in photography, musical instruments like guitars, ukulele, drums, harmonica and trying to get into other string instruments. I love football and my favourte team is Manchester City.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ITSM tools that are competitors to BMC Remedy / Helix like FreshWorks, ServciceNOW, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that include some of the above tools and others.
- 📫 You could reach me at joe.dsouza@yahoo.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: Ukulele is not pronounces as most people tend to but is pronounces as Oooh-cool-lay-lee :)

I am not 100% sure what I will be using this account for but created it at the time of going through ServiceNOW training from their developer training resources on their website. Since this is used as source control applciations, I created this account.

Besides ITSM tools, I believe this can be used as a respository for other resources like GIS data for GIS apps, and quite possibly for film and photography applications. I would like to associate with individuals who may be using this for these applications..
